Does this sound familiar:
> ... a function [has] a side effect if, in addition to returning a value, it also *modifies some state* or has an *observable interaction with calling functions* or the *outside world*.

### Including the following:
 1. modify a global variable or static variable,
 1. modify any hoisted arguments
 1. raise an exception
 1. write data to a display or file
 1. Read data, or,
 1. call other side-effecting functions (HW device IO).

 In the presence of side effects, a program's behavior could become corrupted or invalid in ways that are maddening to debug. A very high level
   the order of evaluation matters. Understanding and debugging a function with side effects requires knowledge about the context and its possible histories.



was more of an under standing of [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science))

So many programmers couldn't tell you what **'side-effects'** are in any random code sample.

Including [classically trained](programming-for-dummies) & highly experienced developer I
