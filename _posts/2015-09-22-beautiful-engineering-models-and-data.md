## The issue we'll examine is deceptively simple & subtle: **Naming**

## The Problem - by Example

Have you ever designed a `data model` (in code, Sql, or excel worksheets)?
Does the following look familiar?

```
*** anti-pattern - don't copy-paste ***
* User
  - id
  - avatarUrl
  - email
  - passwordHash

* Agent
  - id
  - primaryPhoto
  - agentName
  - agentEmail
  - agentPhoneMain
  - agentEmailPrimary
  - agentPhonePrimary
  - agentAddressLine1
  - agentCompanyName
  - agentCompanyAddress
  - *userEmail* - 'Pointer' to User table ^^^
```

If this is familiar to you, I'll bet you:

1. Feel any change to your app will necessitate hours of arduous debugging.
1. Fear ANY Changing Requirements

## The Cost of Bad (Naming) Habits


Let's examine some of the subtle issues (probably familiar):

=======

Why is naming a field `agentEmailPrimary` the worst?

For starters, you are **not** creating an entirely new object unto the universe. Over-specificity has some traps:

1. 'Locked' into highly specific name, means `agentEmailPrimary` probably make your views and related code **0% reusable**, and featuring annoyingly recurring bugs like:
    - Data not syncing between tables (not obvious if `user.email` needs to propagate to `agent.agentEmail` or vice-versa - nevermind complexity of manually implementing where & how to enforce this 'logic' ...)
    - Validation rules/logic are likely duplicated & inconsitent.
    - Increasingly, your project will resemble a shaky Jenga tower.
    - Fragility piles up with every single new file, as an extremely high attention to detail is required for even trivial changes

I know, you probably feel something like...

![fuck this][fuck_this]


## A Solution


```
// Dan's Recommended Schema Consolidation:

User
  - id
  - role: ['agent', 'lead', 'admin']
  - name
  - phone
  - address
  - email
  - passwordHash
  - company
    - name
    - address

```
I removed the `Agent` table, as it didn't contain fields which were uniquely related to Agents.

All changes were made with these general ideas in mind:

1. Eliminate unessesary tables. If you have a few dozen tables, this step is mandatory.
  1. Try merge related tables. **Important if you are coming from a SQL background to No-SQL**
  1. Delete redundant data collection (e.g. remove `ActivityLogs` table if replaced by Google Analytics)
1. Try keeping **all field names** to a **single word/noun/pro-noun**.
  1. There is **no such thing** as `Agent.agentEmail` or `Agent.agentPhonePrimary`. Period.
  1. By using Highly Specific Names, you cast-in-stone a specific level of `code-reusability` and `durability`, well, specifically **ZERO %**.
  1. Don't think you are doing yourself any favors with crap like this `User.profileSummaryEmail` (where 'profile' could include contact details for a personal ads site) . This is probably a good point to create a new table, say `Profiles` which includes `Profiles.email`.
