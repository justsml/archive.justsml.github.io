## HOWTO: Fix Promise Anti-Patterns with Composable JavaScript

> Please take a look at (& star plz) this article's companion Github project, [Escape From Callback Mountain](https://github.com/justsml/escape-from-callback-mountain)
#### Project Goal: research & develop better functional language patterns in JavaScript.

> The subjects I'm addressing have been explored by many - and rejected by others.
I believe the reason for the divide is `Google Results Roulette` & developers blindly trusting results.
Bad/outdated examples lead to broad suspicions of terms like: `modular JS`, `composable JS` or `functional JS`.

Let me start with a confession: I'm guilty of writing the same anti-patterns I criticize below, as I'm sure many JS developers are as well. Nothing I've laid out is meant to be personal or even directed at the original authors. I'm merely doing a code review on common patterns - I hope to pass along an understanding of my priorities & critical thinking processes.

> Hopefully you will be able to spot the warning signs of bad Promises after groking this project.

This is a pretty solid article. I only have 1 concern:

### Q Library

The Q library is one of the most used & oldest to be associated with "Promises." Hence it suffers from aging examples and it's need to maintain backwards compatibility.
**I say "associated with 'Promises'" since I feel Q is really about the `deferred` pattern.**

It may resemble Promises, however I insist it ain't. It has far too large a surface area for all the wrong reasons. Also the naming convention inconsistently abbreviates names, making it harder to memorize the interface. Methods like `when` and `done` are not necessary.

Bottom line: the `deferred` pattern is a painful anti-pattern - it improves virtually nothing over the typical callback approach.
